Mattresses and More has an onboarding workflow for new users of their website. It uses modal pop-ups to welcome users and show them important features of the site like:

The Product team at Mattresses and More has created a new design for the pop-ups that they believe will lead more users to complete the workflow.

They’ve set up an A/B test where:

50% of users view the original control version of the pop-ups
50% of users view the new variant version of the pop-ups
Eventually, we’ll want to answer the question:

How is the funnel different between the two groups?

We will be using a table called onboarding_modals with the following columns:

user_id - the user identifier
modal_text - the modal step
user_action - the user response (Close Modal or Continue)
ab_group - the version (control or variant)


--Count the number of distinct user_id's for each value of modal_text, order by modal_text

SELECT modal_text, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)
FROM onboarding_modals
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

--We can use a CASE statement within our COUNT() aggregate so that we only count user_ids whose ab_group is equal to ‘control’ and 'variant'

SELECT modal_text,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE
    WHEN ab_group = 'control' THEN user_id
    END) AS 'control_clicks',
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE
    WHEN ab_group = 'variant' THEN user_id
    END) AS 'variant_clicks'
FROM onboarding_modals
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

--Find the completion rate for the 'control' group

SELECT modal_text, COUNT (*) AS All_Clicks,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE
    WHEN ab_group = 'control' THEN user_id
    END) AS 'control_clicks',
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE
    WHEN ab_group = 'control' THEN user_id
    END) * 100 / COUNT(*) AS 'control_percent'
FROM onboarding_modals
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

--Find the completion rate for the 'variant' group
SELECT modal_text, COUNT (*) AS All_Clicks,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE
    WHEN ab_group = 'variant' THEN user_id
    END) AS 'variant_clicks',
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE
    WHEN ab_group = 'variant' THEN user_id
    END) * 100 / COUNT(*) AS 'variant_percent'
FROM onboarding_modals
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

-- Conclusion: Which group did better, control or variant group?

Modal	Control Percent	Variant Percent
1	    100%	          100%
2	    60%	            79%
3	    80%	            85%
4	    80%	            80%
5	    85%	            85%

The variant group had a greater completion rate.
